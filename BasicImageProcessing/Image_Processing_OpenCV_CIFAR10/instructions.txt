## Introduction

The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. This project uses the dataset to demonstrate common image processing techniques that can enhance the quality of images for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `tensorflow`
- `matplotlib`
- `opencv-python`
  
You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib opencv-python

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
3. Run the script in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or any IDE).

```bash
python image_processing.py

## Code Overview 
The script performs the following steps:

Load the CIFAR-10 Dataset: Downloads the dataset and splits it into training and test sets.
Normalize Images: Scales pixel values to the range [0, 1].
Display Images: A function to visualize images with their corresponding labels.
Image Processing Functions:
Resize: Resizes images to 64x64 pixels.
Rotate: Rotates images by 15 degrees.
Gaussian Blur: Applies Gaussian blur to the images.
Add Noise: Adds Gaussian noise to the images.
Data Augmentation: Uses Kerasâ€™s ImageDataGenerator to apply random transformations to the images.
Visualization: Displays images at each processing step to showcase the effects of the transformations.
